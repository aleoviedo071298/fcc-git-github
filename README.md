# Super Awesome Game 🎮

This is a small practice project created as part of my learning journey with **Git, GitHub, and basic web development**.

The main goal of this repository is not the final product itself, but to understand and apply the **core version control and collaboration workflow** using Git and GitHub, including branches, pull requests, and publishing a simple web page with **GitHub Pages**.

## 📝 Notes

This repository is part of my learning process and serves as a hands-on exercise while studying Git and GitHub fundamentals.

It focuses on practicing real-world workflows such as branching, pull requests, code reviews, and deployment, and may evolve or be replaced by more advanced projects as I continue improving my skills in **version control, collaboration, and web development**.
