# Super Awesome Game

This is a small practice project created to learn the basics of Git and GitHub.

The goal of this repository is not the final product itself, but to understand and apply the core workflow of version control using Git and publishing a project on GitHub.

## Project structure

- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## What I practiced

- Initializing a local Git repository
- Tracking files with Git
- Staging and committing changes
- Writing clear commit messages
- Connecting a local repository to GitHub
- Pushing changes to a remote repository using SSH

## How to run the project

No build tools or dependencies are required.

## Notes

This repository is part of my learning process and will likely evolve or be replaced by more advanced projects as I continue improving my skills with Git, GitHub, and web development.
